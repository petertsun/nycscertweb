<h1> Portfolio for Summer 2021 Hunter College</h1>
<h3> Teammates: Emma Wingreen, Julian Irimina, Peter Tsun </h3>
<p>During the summer of 2021, a group of about 20 teachers had an opportunity
  to study computer science. This page shows some of the work done
in this computer science program.</p>

<h2> Computer Programming in Java </h2>

<p>
  One of the things we did in computer programming in Java was recursion. In recursion, we consider
  the base case, what to do for recursive call, and what to do after recursive
  call. In the example of fibonacci, the base case is fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1.
  The recursive call is call fib(n-1) and fib(n-2). When the recursive calls return,
  the fib() adds the two returned values: fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).
</p>

<pre>
  <code>

    public static int fib(int n) {
      if(n==0 || n==1){
        return  n;
      }
      else {
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
      }
    }
  </code>
</pre>

<h2> Data Structure </h2>

<p>
  In data structure, we learn about linked list.
  One of the things we got to do is to insert an element in the linked list.
  To understand how it works, we collaborate to create a diagram that shows
  how the pointers should link different nodes in the list. After coding the
  insertion method, we also do another diagram to verify that the code does
  what it should do.
</p>

<pre>
  <code>

    public void insert(int index, String value){
      int count = 0;
      Node currentNode = front;
      Node newNode = new Node(value);
      if (currentNode != null && index == 0){
        newNode.setNext(currentNode);
        front = newNode;
        return;
      }
      while (currentNode != null){
        if (count == index - 1){
          newNode.setNext(currentNode.getNext());
          currentNode.setNext(newNode);
        }
        count = count + 1;
        currentNode = currentNode.getNext();
      }
    }
  </code>
</pre>

<h2> Method 1 </h2>

<p>
  In method, we learn about live coding. In one group,
  Liam Baum showed other people in the group how to introduce
  p5js by live coding a simple animation
</p>

<pre>
  <code>

    // https://editor.p5js.org/

    let x = 100;
    let direction = 1;

    function setup() {
      createCanvas(400, 400);
    }

    function draw() {
      background(220);
      ellipse(x, 200, 50);
      if (x > 375 && direction == 1) {
        direction = -1;
      } else if (x < 25 && direction == -1) {
        direction = 1;
      }
      x = x + direction * 1;
    }

  </code>
</pre>

<h2> Reflection </h2>

<p>
  There is a lot of wonderful things happening in the Hunter CS advanced certificate program.
  It is not just programming, but also about problem solving and analytical thinking.
  We also learn to think through solutions to see if they make sense. Students will
  benefit from these training because teachers are better equipped to guide students
  in their study of computer science and computer engineering.
